In this project, we will be working on detecting and counting vehicles in a given image or a video. We will be using OpenCV for image processing and Haar cascade which is used for object detection. We can also create our own customized haar cascade classifier.



## Step to run application
Step 1: Create the copy of the project. 

Step 2: Open command prompt and change your current path to folder where you can find 'app.py' file. 

Step 3: Create environment by command given below- conda create -name Step 

Step 4: Activate environment by command as follows- conda activate Step 

Step 5: Use command below to install required dependencies- python -m pip install -r requirements.txt Step 

Step 6: Run application by command; python app.py You will get url copy it and paste in browser. Step
 
Step 7: You have sample_data folder where you can get images to test.
## Conclusion:
We started with downloading the image we will be working on and performed different operations on that image. We saw how we can use haar cascade which is used for object detection. We saw how different haar cascade is used for car detection, bus detection. Similarly, you can use many pretrained haar cascades for different object detection.
